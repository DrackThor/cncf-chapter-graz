# K8s roundtable Graz

This is the main git repo of the K8s roundtable Graz.

## Target Audience


We are a group of K8s, DevOps and Cloud enthusiasts.\
This group is dedicated to meetings and get-togethers that may foster the exchange within the community.\
Although most of us are working professionals, this group is not meant to have a company branding whatsoever.\
We are a group for tech savy professionals, interested in exchanging knowledge and experience.

## Meetings / Talks

We aim to meet at least once every 4-6 weeks to exchange thoughts, share experiences and provide talks and presentations.\
Our meetings are held in a hybrid form if possible.\
We meet in person and present our talks offline + online to make our content available to everybody.
